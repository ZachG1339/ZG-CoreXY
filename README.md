# CoreXY-V1
Arduino Based Core XY assembly. All 3D printed components are custom made for this assembly but are compatible with 20x20 extrusion.\\
\\
Required Materials (N and M are arbitrary constants):\\
  *~500g of PLA\\
  *20x20mm extrusion:\\
    *2 (N + 1.57)" for width\\
    *2 M" for length\\
    *4 2" as vertical supports\\
    *1 (M - 1.6)" as the X axis\\
  *Arduino Uno R3 or Mega R3\\
  *GT2 6mm timing belt -> length depends on extrusion length -> approximately 2M + 2N \\
  *8 idler pulleys (5mm bore, 12mm inner diameter, 18mm outer diameter)\\
